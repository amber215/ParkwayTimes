<body> <p>Hi boys. I'm Tina. Sometimes with Jimmy Jr, I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say and it's like okay guys, who can get to my mouth first? Follow me fellas...Lets go somewhere where the sixteen of us can be alone. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. Argh!... Wait, I like the library. Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket, or his pants. I'll wave at you every day. I need both ears to hold up my glasses. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. Time for the charm bomb to explode. Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: 'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.' Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard?</p>

<p>Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. Hi boys. I'm Tina. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! Crap attack? Don't have one? Not if you're a fish. Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. uhhhhhhh It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. Drop the towel. If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morning that ship has sailed. Thank you zombie boyfriends.</p>

<p>Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. Ok then, see you on our date! Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self esteem over a period of years. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. Everyone began to touch each other's butts. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? The s_How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note?</p>

<p>This is where I thrash. YOU GORGEOUS IDIOT! This is where I thrash. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. My crotch is itchy. C'mon Dad, just let me bite down on the bean. Now my rash smells like bacon. But it doesn't itch anymore. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. A pants-off. For me? Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill with one free hand. Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket, or his pants. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note?</p>

<p>I'm compiling a list of people I can mate with to repopulate the Earth. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Argh!... Wait, I like the library. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark gets me. Thank you zombie boyfriends. She grabbed Jimmy Jr's butt and changed the world. Sometimes with Jimmy Jr, I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say and it's like okay guys, who can get to my mouth first? I need both ears to hold up my glasses. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo.</p> </body>
